---JAVASCRIPT DESCRIPTION
    I used JavaScript to add interativity to a button in the footer
    section of the pages, when clicked it triggers a screen transition
    and plays a song, and when clicked again it takes the page back to
    normal and stops the song.

---BOOTSTRAP DESCRIPTION
    I used a lot of Bootstrap to help me construct the pages,
    mainly it's flex functions for aligning and positioning the elements.
