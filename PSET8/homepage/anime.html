                        My favourite anime is Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further Than the Universe), I can't really explain exactly why, it might
                        not have the best plot, animation, etc., although the anime has a really above average level of production all-around. It's
                        themes and characters just resonated with me really well, I would constantly cry multiple times throughout a lot of the episodes,
                        whether the girls were having the time of their lifes or feeling sad and defeated, it all felt so real and close to me, even though
                        I haven't enjoyed my youth nearly as much or don't really plan to, watching Sorayori made me enjoy a youth I didn't have or
                        maybe even made me think to chase some dreams and adventures of my own. And that's why A Place Further Than the Universe is my favourite anime.

                        My favourite manga is Hinamatsuri, to me it's the funniest, I never laughed so hard while reading something, it's comedy just

                        more than I enjoyed Sorayori.
