                            Game - Some type of roguelike, feels like it would be really cool designing one<br>
                            Discord bot - Learning how Discord works would be pretty cool, seeing as I use it almost daily<br>
                            Text Editor - This one would be easier but still pretty hard, I mean I don't even know where to start other than probably having to use a 2d array<br>
                            Table/Cells Editor - This one is like the text editor but probably a lot harder<br>
                            OS - This one is reserved to when I have a lot of time, probably never but still would be pretty cool<br>
                            The goal here is to start making these projects and never stop, to constantly be working on something and getting better, though I doubt I will be able to do that, but I will try! Hopefully my github will soon be filled with those projects.
